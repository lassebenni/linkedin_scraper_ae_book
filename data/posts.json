There is a figure-it-out-yourself mentality in the data & analytics field that I enjoy tremendously, but sometimes it is nice to have a shortcut. The Fundamentals of Analytics Engineering (https://amzn.to/43KxIik) is one of those shortcuts. Each one of the amazing authors brings their own perspective and experience to get you up to speed on data warehouses, data modelling, data ingestion, observability, stakeholder management and navigating the tech landscape.
