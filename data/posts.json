There is a figure-it-out-yourself mentality in the data & analytics field that I enjoy tremendously, but sometimes it is nice to have a shortcut. The Fundamentals of Analytics Engineering (https://amzn.to/43KxIik) is one of those shortcuts. Each one of the amazing authors brings their own perspective and experience to get you up to speed on data warehouses, data modelling, data ingestion, observability, stakeholder management and navigating the tech landscape.

      "text": "Ever since I first started out working with data over 10 years ago Ive had two questions that haunted me.\n- Why does everyone seem to mean something different with the words data or analytics?\n- Why do we need to move and copy data if it is already there?\n\nDo you recognize this? \n- You mention 'analytics' and someone starts talking about cookies while others will refer to their sales dashboard in Excel \n- 'data platform' can mean we've connected every source individually to our dashboard or we run a Terraformed, distributed data lakehouse for streaming and batch as a single source of truth\n- Google 'SQL Tutorial' and you find how to set up your Postgres database for storing transactional data instead of how to aggregate and combine web sessions and sales data\n- GTM either means go to market or Google Tag Manager, depending on your audience\n\nI still do not have a clear answer to both questions, but I find that understanding other teams, roles and their responsibilities and vocabulary helps tremendously to avoid confusion. If you ever find yourself duplicating data again, ask yourself if it facilitates:\n- a different usage pattern\n- a different set of permissions\n- cost efficiency\n\nThese types of questions to me are what analytics engineering is trying to solve.

      "text": "When I wrote the chapter on data governance for our book, Fundamentals of Analytics Engineering, I read many books on the subject. In my opinion, many of them lacked technical depth, were too theoretical, or oversimplified the challenges of transforming an organization's IT landscape. \n\nRecently, I came across the Packt Data Governance Handbook by Wendy Batchelder, and it has quickly become my favorite book on data governance. It is fresh off the press, and I still need to finish the second half, but it has been super helpful! I can't recommend it enough! ",
